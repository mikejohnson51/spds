# These tools are all functions

- R is a statistical computing language that provides _features_ as _functions_ 

--

- Even with just its base installation, R provides hundreds of functions:


```r
length(lsf.str("package:base")) + length(lsf.str("package:stats")) + length(lsf.str("package:utils"))
```

```
[1] 1893
```

--

- sf provides over 100 more


```r
length(lsf.str("package:sf")) 
```

```
[1] 136
```

--

- and the core tidyverse packages (that we use) an additional ~750


```r
length(lsf.str("package:dplyr")) +
length(lsf.str("package:ggplot2")) +
length(lsf.str("package:tidyr")) +
length(lsf.str("package:forcats"))
```

```
[1] 793
```

---

# To date,

- We have been using functions written for us - mostly by `sf` and the `tidyverse`

--

- This how any commercial GIS suite operates as well
 - Analysis and workflows are limited to the tools kits and options exposed to the user
 - In R, a lot more is actually exposed!

--

- Everytime we install a new package, we download code that provides new specific features (as functions)

--

- Everytime we *attach* a package to a working session (`library()`) we are making those functions available/visible

---

## Functions are objects

- Just like `x = 10` binds the value of 10 to the name x creating an object visible in the environment,

--

- functions are objects that can be called by name to execute a set of directions over defined arguments.

--


```r
class(sf::st_intersects)
```

```
[1] "function"
```

```r
class(sf::st_as_sf)
```

```
[1] "function"
```

---

# Our own functions are visable as objects in the environemnt


```r
x = 10
y = data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 10:1)
f = function(x,y){ x  + y }
```

---

# Advancing your programming skills

- One of the best ways to improve your skills as a data scientist is to write functions.

--

- Functions allow you to automate common tasks in a more general way than copy-and-pasting. 

--

- The more times you apply a function, the more incentive you have to optimize it for speed/accuracy

--

- The more creative/unique your analyses and questions can be

---

# So why write functions opposed to scripts?


 - The process can be named
 
--

 - As requirements change, you only need to update code in one place
 
--

 - You eliminate the chance of making incidental mistakes when you copy and paste (forgetting to change `dist_to_state` to `dist_to_border`).
 
--

 - functions can be 'sourced' into Rmd files and R Scripts

--
 - You save youself time

- Data is the first argument (better for pipes!)

--

- Whenever you have copy-and pasted code more than twice you should write a function

--

For example how many times have we coded:


```r
states = USAboundaries::us_states() %&gt;% 
  filter(!name %in% c("Hawaii", "Puerto Rico", "Alaska"))
```

--

- Or made the same table with `knitr`/`kableExtra` only changing the `col.names` and `data.frame`

--

- Or calculated a distance, changed the units, and dropped them?

--

- All of these task are repetitive and prone to making errors that could impact our analysis but not break our code...

---

# The form of a function:

Creating a function follows the form:


```r
name = function(arg1, arg2, *){
  code
  ..
  return(...)
}
```


Where:

--

 - `name` is the function name (e.g. `st_as_sf`)
 
    - This is the name on which R is able to call the object

--

 - `arg1` is the first input
 
--

 - `arg2` is the second input
 
--

 - `*` is any other argument you want to define

--

 - `code ...` defines the instructions to carry out on `arg1` and `arg2`

--
 - `return(...)` is what the function returns
 
---

# Defining a function

 - To define a function we need to identify the code we have, and what can/should generalized for future uses?
 
--


```r
states = USAboundaries::us_states() %&gt;% 
  filter(!name %in% c("Hawaii", "Puerto Rico", "Alaska"))
```

--

 
- Here the input data (us_states) could change

--

- So could the variable name we filter by (name)

---

# Function Signiture

So, lets start with a function that takes general input data and a variable name

--


```r
get_conus = function(data, var){

}
```

---

# Function arguments

Function arguments typically include two two broad sets: 
  -  the data to compute on, 
  -  arguments that control the details of the calculation
  
--

- In `st_transform` `x` is the data, `crs` is the proj4string/EPSG code 

--

- In `ms_simplify` `input` is the data, `keep` defines the directions

--

- In `get_conus`: `data` provides the data, `var` defines the column to filter

--

- Generally, data arguments should come first. 
- Detail arguments should go on the end
- It can be useful - and good practice - to define default values. 
  - should almost always be the most common value. 
  - The exceptions to this rule are to do with safety of the process.
    - e.g. `na.rm = FALSE`
---

# Code body

We then have to carry these generalizations into the function directions using the arguments as our operators:
 

```r
get_conus = function(data, var){
  conus = filter(data, !!var %in% c("Hawaii", "Puerto Rico", "Alaska"))
  return(conus)
}
```

--

 - here, we replace `us_states()` with `data`
 
--

 - we use `get()` to return the *value* of a *named* object

--

 - We assign our filtered object to the name `conus`
 
--

 - And explicitly return the `conus` object from the function

--

***

- The value returned by the function is *usually* the last evaluated statement, if we don't specify return we can take advantage of this default:


```r
get_conus = function(data, var){
  filter(data, !get(var) %in% c("Hawaii", "Puerto Rico", "Alaska"))
}
```

---

# Using our function:

- Like any object, we have to run the lines of code to save it as an object before we can use it directly in our code:

- But then ...

---
# It's ok to be more detailed

- Another advantage of functions is that if our requirements change, we only need to make the change our code in one place. 

--

- This also means we can spend more time fine-tuning our code since we know it will be recycled.

--

- Here we can be more focused and make sure to remove other potential "non-conus" states from any input object:


```r
get_conus = function(data, var){
  filter(data, !get(var) %in% 
           c("Hawaii", "Puerto Rico", "Alaska",
             "Guam", "District of Columbia"))
}
```

--


```r
conus = get_conus(us_states(), "name")
nrow(conus)
```

```

# Point-in-Polygon Case Study

- The power of GIS lies in analyzing multiple data sources together. 

- Often the answer you want lies in many different layers and you need to do some analysis to extract and compile information. 

- One common analysis is Points-in-Polygon (PIP). 

-  PIP is useful when you want to know how many - or what kind of -  points fall within the bounds of each polygon

--

&lt;img src="lec-img/14-pip.jpg" width="406" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- In 176A/176B you will learn about other useful ways of analysis point/polygon relationships such as point pattern analysis, interpolation, and others

# Data

### CONUS counties

```r
counties = st_transform(us_counties(), 5070) %&gt;% 
  select(name, geoid, state_name) %&gt;% 
  get_conus("state_name")
```

--

### CONUS Starbucks

```r
starbucks = read_csv('data/directory.csv') %&gt;% 
  filter(!is.na(Latitude), Country == "US") %&gt;% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs = 4326) %&gt;% 
  st_transform(5070) %&gt;% 
  st_filter(counties) %&gt;% 
  select(store_name = `Store Name`)
```

--

### California Counties 

```r
ca = filter(counties, state_name == "California")
```

---

# Step 1: Spatial Join

To count the Starbucks locations in CA counties, we start by joining the CA counties to the locations:

--

 - Here we uses the `counties` as the x table and the locations as the y table
 
 - This is because we want to **add** the starbucks information to the `county` sf object.

--

 - Remember the default of `st_join` is a `left_join` on the `st_intersects` predicate

--


```r
(starbucks1 = st_join(ca, starbucks))
```

# Step 2: Point counts by Polygon

`count()` is a dplyr function that "*lets you quickly count the unique values of one or more variables: df %&gt;% count(a, b) is roughly equivalent to df %&gt;% group_by(a, b) %&gt;% summarise(n = n())*"

---

# Now for Colorado?

We can anticipate that PIP is a useful process we want to implement over variable points and polygons pairs

--

So, lets make a function named `point_in_polygon`, that takes a `point` dataset and a `polygon` dataset

--


```r
point_in_polygon = function(points, polygon){
 st_join(polygon, points) %&gt;% 
   count(geoid)
}
```

```

]

---

# Generalizing the `count` variable

- In its current form, `point_in_polygon` only counts on `geoid`

--

- Lets modify that by making the variable name an input
  - again, we use `get()` to return the *value* of a *named* object 
  - we call this, variable `id`

--


```r
point_in_polygon2 = function(points, polygon, var){
  st_join(polygon, points) %&gt;% 
    count(get(var))
}
```

---

# Applying the new function

- Here, we can apply the PIP function over **states** and _count_ by `name`

--


```r
states = get_conus(us_states(), "name") %&gt;% 
  st_transform(5070)

state_sb = point_in_polygon2(starbucks, states, 'name')

plot(state_sb['n'])
```

&lt;img src="lecture-14_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Optimizing functions 

- Lets apply our function over the counties and see how long it takes

--

- We can check the time it takes by wrapping our function in `system.time`

--


```r
system.time({
  us = point_in_polygon(starbucks, counties)
})

# user    system  elapsed 
# 3.719   0.354   4.309 
```

---

# Thats not bad...


```r
# How many seconds per point?
(point_per_sec = 4.3 / (nrow(counties) * nrow(starbucks)))
```

```

```

--

- ~ 30 seconds to test ~282,100,000 point/polygon relations is not bad, but could be a bottle neck in analysis

--

- Lets look at a common means for improvement...

---

# To keep geometery or not?

- Remember our geometries are **sticky**, that means they carry through all calculations - whether they are needed or not

--

- We can ease _alot_ of computational overhead by being mindfull of when we retain our geometry data with our attribute data.

### "Function-izing" our improvements


```r

# What else can we wrap?

- What about a really nice, clean, informative plot?

--

- ggplots look great but can be time consuming to program...

--

- A function would allow us to take care of the groundwork 

--



```r
plot_pip = function(data){
  ggplot() + 
    geom_sf(data = data, aes(fill = log(n)), alpha = .9, size = .2) + 
    scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "darkgreen") + 
    theme_void() + 
    theme(legend.position = 'none',
          plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", color = "darkgreen", hjust = .5, size = 24)) +
    labs(title = "Starbucks Locations",
         caption = paste0(sum(data$n), " locations represented")) 
}
```

- This is great because we can devote the time to making a nice plot and we will be able to recycle the work over other cases...

# Moving beyond Starbucks?

- [Here](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/points_in_polygon.html#:~:text=One%20such%20type%20of%20analysis,use%20this%20method%20of%20analysis.) is a nice tutorial of point-in-polygon in QGIS. It is looking at earthquakes by country.

- Just like us they use `naturalearth` data for the polygon areas

- And they are looking at earthquake data maintained by NOAA.

- In R, we can read the NOAA data directly from a URL.

- The data is a tab delimited txt file so we use `readr::read_delim()`

---


```r
sf::sf_use_s2(FALSE)
countries = st_as_sf(rnaturalearth::countries110)

url = 'http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/results?type_0=Exact&amp;query_0=$ID&amp;t=101650&amp;s=13&amp;d=189&amp;dfn=signif.txt'

quakes  = read_delim(url, delim = "\t") %&gt;% 
  filter(!is.na(LATITUDE), !is.na(LONGITUDE)) %&gt;% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("LONGITUDE", "LATITUDE"), crs = 4326) %&gt;%     
  st_transform(st_crs(countries))

nrow(countries)
```

```
[1] 177
```

```r
nrow(quakes)
```

```
[1] 6198
```

```r
nrow(st_intersection(quakes, countries))

# PIP --&gt; Plotting Method

- We can use our functions right out of the box for this data 

--

- But... somethings are not quite right..


```r
point_in_polygon3(quakes, countries, var = "admin") %&gt;% plot_pip() 
```

&lt;img src="lecture-14_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-48-1.png" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Modify for our analysis ...


```r
point_in_polygon3(quakes, countries, var = "admin") %&gt;% 
* plot_pip() +
  labs(title = "Earthquake Locations") + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c() + 
  geom_sf(data = quakes, size = .25, alpha = .05, col = 'red')
```

# Improve the anaylsis...


```r
point_in_polygon3(quakes, countries, var = "admin") %&gt;% 
  plot_pip() + 
  labs(title = "Earthquake Locations",
       subtitle = "Most impacted countries") + 
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = .5),
        plot.title = element_text(color = "navy")) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c() + 
  geom_sf(data = quakes, size = .3, alpha = .05, col = 'red') +
  gghighlight::gghighlight(n &gt; (mean(n) + sd(n)))

# Lab 3: Set up

### Data


```r
states_u = get_conus(us_states(), "name") %&gt;% 
  st_union() %&gt;% 
  st_cast("MULTILINESTRING")

states_c = get_conus(us_states(), "name") %&gt;% 
  st_combine() %&gt;% 
  st_cast("MULTILINESTRING")

countries = st_as_sf(rnaturalearth::countries110)
```

### Function

```r
dist_5070_km = function(g1, g2){
  g2 = st_transform(g2, crs = st_crs(g1))
  drop_units(set_units(st_distance(g1,g2),"km")) %&gt;% 
  as.vector()
}
```

# Assignment

- Compute and plot the number of cities in each US (CONUS) county as a PIP plot

 - Use the `uscities.csv` to create your points
 
 - Use `USAboundaries::us_states()` to define your polygons
 
 - Use the PIP function developed here to compute PIP counts
 
 - *MODIFY* the `plot_pip` function to plot your data
 
 - save your plot with `ggsave()`

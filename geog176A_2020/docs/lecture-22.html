# Data Science
---

# Day #1: Introduction

- GEOG 176A is part of a 3-part series, you are just getting started!

--

- Our goal was to learn the _underlying utilities_ and _concepts_ that drive **all** GIS platforms

--

- We chose to use `R` because it offers a powerful data science component and spatial component built on the international standards (simple features and raster)

--

- Programming is about finding a sequence of instructions to perform/automate a task (like your labs)

--

- The learning curve for coding is difficult and things click at different times

---

# Day #2: Geoinformatics

- Information and Geographic _Systems_

--


- Information and Geographic _Science_

--


- Spatial Data Science - or - **Geoinformatics**

--


_How do we combine the knowledge of computer science, mathmatics, information science, and data science to answer geographic questions?_


--


  - Understand our computer and systems for working with digital data in a reproducible, flexible way.

--

  - Have a strong foundation in standard data manipulation and data visualization

--

  - Understand what makes "spatial" special including familiarity with vector objects, raster fields, and time.


---

# Day #3: The Digital Environment

- **Files** : comprised of a path, name and extension

  - Files are made of of bits and bytes
  
--

- **Naming things:** 
  - being intentional about how we name "things" (directories, files, and variables)
  - focusing on making names machine and human readable, as well as sortable (think lab 5!)

--

- **Never, never, never, never have spaces in your paths or names!!!**

--

- RStudio Projects as a way of enforcing a common  working directory

--

- All projects contain structure, and almost all projects (ArcMap, R, Java, Word) can use the same structure

--

- Never, never, never, never use `setwd()`!!!


---
# Our goal for good GI science ...
*Well-annotated*: Through documentation and comments

*Organized*: Project Structure

*Raw Data*: Keep raw data raw!

*Final Reports*: Rmarkdown files

*Unbreakable Paths*: Rproj to the rescue

*Complete History*: Version control with git and GitHub

--

For this we learned Rmarkdown, GitHub, GitHub Pages, Rmd files, and R scripts

---

# Day #4: Data Types and Structure

- Data Types (logical, numeric, integer, **raw**)

--

- Dates, factors, POSIXct are S3 classs built on these primitive types


--

- Types can be stored as atomic (single-type) vectors

--

- Vectors can have dimension!
  - 2D is a matrix
  - 3D is an array
  
-- 

- Multiple vectors of varying size can be stored as a list

--

- A `data.frame` is a list of equaled sized 1D vectors.

--

- data.frames drive our vectors view of the world
- diminsioned vectors drive our raster view of the world

---

# Day #5: Data Frame Manipulation

- Grammer of Data manipulation: `dplyr`

--

- Based on SQL (Structured Query Language)

--

- Pure verbs: `select` (columnwise reduction) and `filter` (row-wise reduction)

--

- Manipulation verbs: `mutate` (add), `summarize` (reduce), `arrange` (sort)

--


- The level of analysis can be controlled by `group_by`

---

# Day #6: Data Visulaization

- Grammar of Graphics: `ggplot`

--

- ggplot graphics are built step by step by adding new elements and layers

  - Data
  - Geometry (geom)
  - Aesthetic mapping
  - Theme
  - Elements of a plot are layered by iteritavly adding elements
  
--

- These can be added in a series of 5 steps:

  - Setup
  - Layers
  - Labels
  - Facets
  - Themes
  
---

# Day #7: Relations and Format

- Joining data

--

  - Data can be integrated/joined/merged by defining a relation (relational data)

--

  - Relations are defined by a shared key (*primary* and *foreign*)

--

  - The join operation you chose dictates which dataset "dominates" the join
    - left, right, inner, full, semi, and anti joins

--
  
Data can be formatted in different ways:

--

  - "tidy" or "wide" way (each row is one observation)

--

  - Or "long"  (each row is one data point)

--

- `pivot_wider` and `pivot_longer` allow us to move between these forms

--

- `sfc` columns cannot yet be pivoted! (`st_drop_geometry`)

---

# Day #8: Time and Summary

- Lags and rolling functions are useful for feature-based time data

--

- Recreated graphics from the NY-Times related to COVID using table manipulation and ggplot

---

# Spatial Objects
---


# Day #9: Spatial Data Libraries

- OSGeo and OGC are high-level governing bodies for geospatial libraries

--

# GEOS 
  - ports a subset of the JTS Topology Suite which conforms to the Simple Features specification for SQL

--

  - Provides an object model for planar geometry and geometric functions

--

  - Area and distance functions, spatial predicats (DE-9IM) overlay, buffer, simplifications, voronoi tesselation ...

--

  - Reading and writing of WKT and WKB (as well as GML)

--

# PRØJ

- transforms geospatial coordinates from one coordinate reference system (CRS) to another including cartographic projections and geodetic transformations.

---

# GDAL

- provides a software library for reading and writing raster and vector data formats

--

- presents a single abstract data model to the calling application for all supported formats.

---

# PostGIS

  - PostGIS (POST-jis) follows the Simple Features for SQL specification
  
--

  - adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL object-relational database.

# PostgreSQL

  - is relational database management system (R/DBMS) emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.


---

# sf: Simple features in R

Binds to these libraries represents simple features as records (rows) in a `data.frame` _with_ a geometry list-column


```r
library(sf)
sf::sf_extSoftVersion()
```

```
          GEOS           GDAL         proj.4 GDAL_with_GEOS     USE_PROJ_H 
       "3.8.1"        "3.1.1"        "6.3.1"         "true"         "true" 
```


&lt;img src="lec-img/09-sf-depends.png" width="497" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---

# Day #10: Simple Features

Simple features refer to the formal standard (ISO 19125-1:2004) describing how objects in the real world can be represented in computers, with emphasis on the spatial geometry of these objects.

Simple features require 2 components a geometry and a CRS

---

# Day #10: Simple Features

- 17 geometry types with the "big" 7

--

- All geometries are composed of `POINT` features

--

- `POINT` features can have 2-4 dimensions (XYZM), but are 0 dimensional features!

- `LINESTRING` features are an ordered set of POINTS (1D feature)

- `POLYGON` features are a ordered, closed set of POINTS (2D feature)

--

- Geometries can be encoded as WKT or WKB (human and machine readable forms)

--

- Geometries can be cast to other forms but need to be leveled (`st_cast`, `st_union`, `st_combine`)

---

# In R

- each geometry is a `sfg`

--

- a collection of `sfg` features is `sfc` (list-column)

--

- an `sfc` can be added to a data.frame of attributes to create a `sf`

&lt;img src="lec-img/10-sf-diagram.png" width="499" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
# Day #11: CRS

How do we take a 3D earth and translate it into a 2D (planar) planar representation? 

--

- Geographic coordinate systems (GCS) identify a location on the Earth’s surface using longitude and latitude.

  - Longitude is the angular distance East or West of the Prime Meridian plane.

  - Latitude is angular distance North or South of the equatorial plane.
  
--

- The _surface_ of the Earth in GCS is represented by _ellipsoidal_ surface.

- Ellipsoidal models are defined by two parameters: the semi major and semi minor axis

---

- Ellipsoids are part of a wider component of GCSs: the datum

- Datums describe the irregularities in a earths surface (geoid) compared to a smooth ellipsoid surface

&lt;img src="lec-img/22-geoid.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Datum 

&lt;img src="lec-img/22-GCS.png" width="444" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

- It is difficult to measure things like area, distance, or length on a `3D` model 

--

- think of the speed in calculating geodesic (ellipsoid based) distances in lab 2)

--

- Therefore we need a `2D` planar surface to compute geometric properties

--

- To create this we must **project** the GCS to a _Projected Coordinate System_

--

- Every PCS distorts the 3D surface is some way (`area`, `shape`, `distance`, `size`)

--

- All PCS have a unit of measurement and a false origin unique to that projection

--

- These are defined in the `proj4string`, and if common, and `EPSG` integer identifier

---

# Day #12: Spatial Predicates

- Geometries have `interiors`, `exteriors` and `boundaries` (3)

--

- The relation between two geometries can be defined by the intersection of these three states (`3x3 = 9`)

--

- Intersection can occur as `0D` (point), `1D` (line), or `2D` (area)

--

- These 9 intersections define the DE-9IM matrix which can have the set domain of `{0,1,2,F}` or `{T,F}`

--

- The DE-9IM string for an intersection is something like `T*F**FFF*` 

--

- Certain combinations of the DE-9IM matrix are so common that they  are called spatial predicates  
  - `equals`, `disjoin`, `touches`, `contains`, `covers`, `intersects`, etc

--
  
- These spatial predicates are "masks" that test against DE-9IM strings to return `{T,F}` conditions

---

# Day #13: Unary, Binary, Simplification

- Spatial predicates can be used to *join* and *filter* spatially (boolean reducers)

--

- Simplification is a way of reducing the vertex count in a geometry to speed up topology calculations

--

  - Looked at the **Douglas–Peucker** methods which works feature by feature

--

  - **Visvalingam** (`rmapshaper`): which is topology preserving 

--

- Looked at **Unary** (single) feature operations like `centroids`, `buffer`, and `bbox`

--

- Looked at **Binary** (mutli) feature operations like `intersection` (clip), `union`, `combine` 

---

# Day #14: Writing Functions

- Realized that `functions` are `R` objects (of type `closure`)

--

- Began to look at reducing our repetitious work flows by writing functions


--

- Created plotting and a Point-in-Polygon (PIP) function

---

# Day #15: MAUP and Tessalations

- We introduced the idea of object (discrete) and field (continuous) views of the world (Kuhn 2012)

--

- Discussed ways to produce object based coverages using:

  - `tessellations` (`grid` and `hexagon`) 
  - `triagulation` (Delaunay) 
  - `Voroni` (Thiessen) polygons

--

- The last two required "anchor" points

--

- Each tessellation type has pros and cons depending on the use, size and  application

--

- We discussed some of these implications in the contexts of gerrymandering

--

- The notion of a square/grid (`st_make_grid`) tessellation carries us into our raster discussion

---

# Day #16: Interactive Web Mapping

- Web tiles are served as 256 x 256 pixel png files indexed as {X}{Y}{Z}: Z equals Zoom

&lt;img src="lec-img/16-zoom-0.png" width="114" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

- Each zoom level (0-21) breaks the tiles from the previous zoom into 4 new pieces.

--

- This tiling allows only the data that needed to be rendered

--

- Is the basis for Google Earth Engine

---

# Field Data
---

# Day #17: Raster Data Model

- Raster Data is 2-pronged: _values_ and _structure_

--

- **values** are diminsioned vectors - nothing more (`getValues()`)

--

- **Structure** is intentionally light weight and without coordinates:

&lt;img src="lec-img/18-raster.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---

- *colors* are mapped over a _range_ and a _set number of breaks_, on screen you can have 256 colors 

- 8-bit color graphics are a method of storing image information in a computer's memory or in an image file, so that each pixel is represented by one 8-bit byte.

- The maximum number of colors that can be displayed at any one time is 256 or 28
---

# Day #18: Raster Data Manipulation

- Raster data can be cropped and masked

--

- Masks are a version of a local operation where 1 = keep, NA = remove

--

- Looked carefully at `reclassify`, `cellStats` (global), `calc` (local)

--

- Focused on raster thesholding on conditions and statements

--

- The raster class has specific implementations of _logical_, _algebraic_, and _common_ functions, for anything outside of these `calc` should be used


--

# OSM

- Open Street Map is a rich source for feature data about "anything"

--

- Data is accessed through the Overpass Query (POSTs an http request)

--

- Data is scoped by a bounding box, and a `key=value` pair

--

- The OSM Wiki is a one stop shop to identify key=value pairs

--

- OSM data is organized as node/way/area which we know as `POINT`/`LINESTRING`/`POLYGON`

---

# Raster Vector Realations

- Vector data (like OSM) can be used to summarize or ask questions about raster data:

--

- `raster::extract`: extracts cell values that intersect with a geometery
- `fasterize::fasterize`: convert vector to raster)
- `textractr::exact_extract`: performs zonal summaries for a feature set

---

# Day #19: Map Alegra and OSM

- **Local** operations are applied to each individual cell and only involve those cells sharing the same location.

--

- **Focal** operations assigns summary values to the output cells based on the neighboring cells in the input raster. **Requires a window and a reducer**

--

- **Zonal** operations compute a summary values (such as the mean) from cells aggregated to some zonal unit.

--

- **Global** operations make use of some or all input cells when computing an output cell value.

---

# Day #20: Categorization

- A common task (arguably all of remote sensing) is about understanding and classifiying/categorizing patterns that occur

--

- This process is about reducing the dinimsionality or the noise in a dataset

--

- We looked at the `kmeans` algorithm which is an unsupervised classification method.

&lt;img src="lec-img/20-kmeans-5.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
--

- Other more technical techniques include random forest, decision tree, and other clustering algorithms

---

# Day #21: Terrain Analysis

- Terrain analysis is a common task to make sense of elevation data. 

--

- In its own right is a form of classification

--

- Terrain analysis implements complex (e.g. 3d-finite difference) neighborhood functions

--

- Specifically we looked at `hillshade`, `slope`, `aspect`, and `HAND`

--

- We can speed these processes up by using `whitebox`

--

- Using `whitebox` introduced a second valuable skill about interfacing with _command line utilities_ which require path names rather then in memory objects as input (this is largley how ArcMap works!)

--

- These types of tools are one way of locally speeding up complex/intensive calculations

---

# Day #22: Google Earth Engine

- A remote solution to speed up intensive raster calculations

--

- Upcoming integration with AI and ML via TensorFlow

--

- The mentioned forest analysis: 700,000,000,000,000 pixels!

--

- We also saw that the spatial implementation was not different (just javascript syntax)

--

  - properties/attributes, 
  - working environment, 
  - variables, 
  - assignment, 
  - WKT, 
  - filter, 
  - reducers (summarize), 
  - indexing ([])
